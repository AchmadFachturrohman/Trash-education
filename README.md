# Machine Learning

## This branch contains:
1. Datasets that we use to create our models:
> * The [Splitted](https://github.com/HansAnderson19/Trash-education/tree/Machine_Learning/Splitted) is the datasets that still use 6 class, which is: carboard, paper, metal, glass, plastic, trash.
> * The [Splitted_Without_Trash_Class](https://github.com/HansAnderson19/Trash-education/tree/Machine_Learning/Splitted_Without_Trash_Class), is the datasets that we use in the end, we decide to exlcude trash class because it makes more misclassification in our model.
> * We get the datasets from [Garbage Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/asdasdasasdas/garbage-classification) on kaggle.
2. Our tflite Saved model in [Model ResNet50V2](https://github.com/HansAnderson19/Trash-education/tree/Machine_Learning/Model%20ResNet50V2).
3. You can see the process of how we make the model here [Final_Project_Bangkit_Resnet_Tuning_Process_V4.ipynb](https://github.com/HansAnderson19/Trash-education/blob/Machine_Learning/Final_Project_Bangkit_Resnet_Tuning_Process_V4.ipynb).
4. We test the model using this notebook [Testing_model.ipynb](https://github.com/HansAnderson19/Trash-education/blob/Machine_Learning/Testing_model.ipynb).
